This week all we did was work on our blogs and make sure our shop on google sheets is good. This is how far I've got with my shop:

All I've done is make a list of products and their price, then I made a vlookup command so all the shop worker has to do is type in the item name and it will give a drop down menu of what the item could be. Then they put in the quantity of it and a total comes up and they charge the customer. Simple. See you next week.
