Target: Get to 5% on Code Cademy

This lesson we started to work on a website called Code Cademy. This website helps you learn to code in a lot of different ways but we are focusing of the code called Python. At the start of this lesson we started by learning what the website was and what you could do on it and a quick demonstration. Then we were set off to get as much as we could of the program in the lesson. Halfway through the lesson the internet went down but after it came back up I tried to keep at my target of 5%. There was one piece of code I was stuck on. It was this:

"""

The string "PYTHON" has six characters,

numbered 0 to 5, as shown below:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+

| P | Y | T | H | O | N |

+---+---+---+---+---+---+

  0   1   2   3   4   5

However I did not read this:

So if you wanted "Y", you could just type

"PYTHON"[1] (always start counting from 0!)

"""

So I kept typing:

fifth_letter = "MONTY" [5]

When it should have been:

fifth_letter = "MONTY" [4]

I kept at my target and by the end of the lesson I had got to 5%.

See you next week!
