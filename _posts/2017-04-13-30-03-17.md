Hey Guys. Today was all about trying to get as many cool things done with the robot arm as I could. First I picked up a pencil and put it in my hand. Then for the rest of the lesson I tried to bottle flip with the robot arm I failed as I could not work out how to make three commands work at the same time. The rest of the lesson after I worked that out was trying to get code pre programmed so the arm could pick up the pencil and put it somewhere else without me having to do it manually but I couldn't figure it out. That was the whole lesson. See you next time!
