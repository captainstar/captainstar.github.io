Hey Guys. Today's lesson was reasonably fun as throughout the lesson we just worked through the booklet. For most of the lesson we completed the lesson which was about creating images using ones and zeros. The booklet example was 'I love space invaders'. Then I made my own one using the ‘DEFCHAR’ method. It was a fish so mine was ‘I love space invaders plus fish’. That was pretty much the whole lesson. See you next week.
