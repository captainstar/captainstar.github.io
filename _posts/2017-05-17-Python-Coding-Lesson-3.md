Target: To get to 28% on CodeCademy.

This lesson I was good as I had done loads of homework so I did not have to do as much in the lesson. I was on 19% at the end of the lesson but I had done a whole section for homework so I wanted to do more in the lesson (one section). I did a lot as I finished the section and I was working really well. I got to my target and I will finish this section and the next for homework.

See you next week!
