Hey guys. Today we did something new. The Fuse Box! The fuse box is pretty much a 'Raspberry Pi' but with a keyboard. This lesson we tried to set it up and then we started on the program. We first had to create a program with a continuous round of the words ‘Hello World’. This made it look like the matrix. There was one problem because when you type in ‘Hello World’ the next one starts right next to it so you had to type in ’Hello World ‘ or  Hello World’. The next problem was that the computer that we were at was faulty so every minute or so  the monitor switched off. We only got to the end of the first lesson because of our computer/ monitor/ fuse box was faulty. Next lesson we will try to get on another monitor so we can get through much faster. See you next time!
