Hey Guys. Today we had quite a fun lesson as we just carried on with the fuse box. Doing the fuse box was fun as we just had to practice on it or carry on with the workbook. I just did one exercise and then personalised it a lot as from all the knowledge that I had acquire and made a quite cool program. Our lesson objective was to create and learn more about our fuse box and it was actually quite fun. Some people had some very awesome programmes. I need to remember to bring in a memory stick to store my progress as I did not have one today. As last week our computer was not working we switched computers and fuse boxes so we could carry on with our task with no interference which worked. By the end I had a programme with over 60 lines in it. See you next week.
