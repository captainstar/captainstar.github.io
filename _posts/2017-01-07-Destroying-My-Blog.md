   Last year I had a blog which I put in a lot of hard work but this year I had to destroy it and create a new one. 

   This lesson we had to fill in a Google form which was not the most fun thing but it had to be done. Then we spent the rest of the lesson trying to re create our blogs after we deleted it which involved a lot of waiting around for other people to figure out what they had to do. That was all the lesson pretty much.

   See you next time.
