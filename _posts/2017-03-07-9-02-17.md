Hey Guys. Last lesson was quite fun from what I remembered but as I am writing this in the half-term I can't remember it that well. We first got our fuse boxes out and finally we finished setting ours up first! Then for most of the lesson I made some code that was like a 'Q and A' set-up. That was all we did pretty much as that was quite a long part of the booklet. See you next week.
