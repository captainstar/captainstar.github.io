Hey Guys. This lesson we tried to change our background and that was pretty much the lesson. When had to find an image with either .jpg or .png. My background as you can see is ORANGES. They are my favourite fruit and colour. I had time at the end so I just made sure that my background fitted the whole background without creating multiples of itself. See you next week.
