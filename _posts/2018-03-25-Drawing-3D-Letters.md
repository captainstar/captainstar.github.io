In this lesson I started to draw letters and as I wasn't last lesson I had to catch up and draw a 3D letter straight away. It was quite hard but eventually I got it and it was very simple. All you had to do was draw lines with the turtle and use commands like turtle.pendown() or turtle.penup() to put the pen up and down on the page. I drew a 3D T.

It looked like this:

The code is this:

def draw_T():

  turtle.begin_fill()

  turtle.left(90)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.forward(100)

  turtle.left(90)

  turtle.forward(30)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(80)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(30)

  turtle.left(90)

  turtle.forward(100)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.penup()

  turtle.end_fill()

  turtle.right(180)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.left(45)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.penup

  turtle.left(180)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(135)

  turtle.forward(100)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(30)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.left(45)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.penup

  turtle.left(180)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(135)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.right(45)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.penup

  turtle.left(180)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(45)

  turtle.forward(80)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.left(225)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(45)

  turtle.forward(80)

  turtle.right(90)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.penup()

  turtle.right(45)

  turtle.forward(20)

  turtle.right(45)

  turtle.forward(15)

  turtle.left(90)

  turtle.pendown()

  turtle.forward(86)

  turtle.penup()

  turtle.forward(30)

  

draw_T()
