This lesson we just did more coding and I just went through the parts in the section 'Functions' and did about 4 sections in the lesson. It wasnâ€™t particularly hard but I just had to think and get through it. It is just logic as they had offers for different amounts of days but you had to be logical. You can basically read it in English:

def rental_car_cost (days):

    if days >= 7:

        return 40 * days - 50

    elif days >= 3:

        return 40 * days - 20

    elif days >= 0:

        return 40 * days

That was the lesson. See you next week!
