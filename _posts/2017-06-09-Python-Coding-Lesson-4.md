This lesson we actually did not do anything on code cademy but our teacher taught us about decomposing. This is when you take something as easy like filling a kettle but you break it down into smaller things like fill kettle with water from the tap by turning the handle. This is like coding as in coding you have to program something by telling it all the small details. See you next week.
