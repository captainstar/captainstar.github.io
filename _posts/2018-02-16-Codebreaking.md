This lesson we started to build a device on google sheets to be able to build a code and break a code by just giving the person who is receiving it the instructions to put into the sheet. All we had to do was write the alphabet and then write the alphabet a few letters down so that the code is jumbled up. Then you could make a vlookup to be able to write your message in to it and the coded message would come up underneath. Then w used a new command that collated all the data and made it into one sentence which you can send to your friend. Then we found other ways to encode writing like a word to put in the start like how the enigma code worked.
