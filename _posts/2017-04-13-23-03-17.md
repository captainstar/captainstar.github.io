Hey Guys. This lesson was awesome as we could now get on to programming the robot arms. You just set up the program by writing the code from the booklet and then you you just write what it said. For example ArmGripper (9) would move the gripper. It was very cool. Some people even tried to pick up a pencil like this but I am going to do this next lesson. See you next week!
