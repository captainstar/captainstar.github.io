Hey Guys. Todays lesson was quite fun as I finally figured out what the code which I was working on last week does. You put lights on the breadboard and then you put some wires and resistors to the sockets and the lights light up in this weird pattern. I think if you change the code you can possibly change the pattern of the bulbs lighting up. See you next week.
