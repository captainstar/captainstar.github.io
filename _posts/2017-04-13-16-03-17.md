 Hey Guys. In  todays lesson all I did was carry on trying to modify the code that I had made last lesson. It was quite fun as you could almost make the lights change order by changing the numbers in the code. You could take the lights out and make them different colours by switching the bulbs. At the end of the lesson I saw what I could do next and that was robot arms. I can't wait for next weeks lesson. See you next time.
