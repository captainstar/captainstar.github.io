Target: to get to 20% on Code Cademy

As we missed last lesson due to doing the Junior Maths Challenge we were slightly behind on the amount of code we had to do in the week. Luckily I had done quite a bit for homework so I was ahead on what everyone else was on. I worked steadily through the lesson and by the end I got to 19%. All I have to do is to finish this section (one question) and I will get past 20%.

See you next week!
