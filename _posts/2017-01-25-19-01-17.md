Hey Guys. This lesson my teacher was not here. This meant that we had a cover teacher. This was fun because as soon as we had done the class work then we could play on light bot. This is a coding game which you have to make the bot light up lol the tiles necessary. I did not do all the work because for most of the lesson I could not figure out how to get it to work. This was extraordinarily annoying. See you next week.
